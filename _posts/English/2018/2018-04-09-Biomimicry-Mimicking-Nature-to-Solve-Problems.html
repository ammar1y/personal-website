<p>In 1989, Japan&#39;s Shinkansen Bullet Train had a problem: it caused a loud sound
  whenever it exited a tunnel, a sound that could be heard 400 meters away. This
  constituted an annoying problem for people who were living near those tunnels. So, Japan
  decided to design a new train; the new train had components that were based on birds:
  Owls inspired the <a

  the Adelie Penguin inspired the pantograph supporting shaft; and most notably, the
  kingfisher whose unique beak inspired the train nose which reduced the noise to be under
  the noise limit in residential areas. There is a name for designs like this: it is
  called <strong>biomimicry</strong>.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Biomimicry&quot; was coined by Janine Benyus who wrote a book named
  &quot;Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature&quot; that told the story of innovations
  in computing, energy, and health that were inspired by the natural world. She suggests
  that designers should bring a biologist to the table to help in solving problems by
  mimicking nature.</p>
