<p>I think it is one of the best resources to start learning Python in a way that lets you
  really build interesting applications that you can use in your life; for example,
  applications that let you do things that would take normally a long time in a very short
  time, applications that harness the great computing power of your device for your uses.
  With this resource, you will be able to make programs that can show you real-world uses
  of programming. The resource is a book named &quot;Automate the Boring Stuff With
  Python&quot; by Al Sweigart. It is available online for free on this link: <a

<p>Check the book, and let me know if it worked for you like it did for me.</p>
