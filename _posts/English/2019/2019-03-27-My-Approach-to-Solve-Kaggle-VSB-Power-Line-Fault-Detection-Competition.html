<p>In this document, I will briefly explain my way of solving the VSB Power Line Fault
  Detection competition. The metric used in that competition was Matthews correlation
  coefficient (MCC) between the predicted and the observed response. My final score was
  0.58655; the best score was 0.71899 (a difference of 0.13244); the worst score was
  -0.28109.</p>
<p>The goal of the competition was to detect partial discharge patterns in signals
  acquired from power lines. The competition data consists of 800,000 readings for around
  29,000 signals (8712 for training and the rest for testing). For each signal, we need to
  determine if it has a partial discharge or not. The signal data contains a lot of
  background noise according to the competition organizers.</p>
<h1 data-breakpage>1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h1>
<p>EDA is the process that I started with and continued using throughout the competition
  to understand the data, to spot some useful patterns, and to choose proper parameters
  for some functions.</p>
<p>The image below shows the 3 phases of some signal:</p>

<h1 data-breakpage>2. The Submission Code</h1>
<p>The submission code is the code used to produce the submission file that competitors
  submit to Kaggle. </p>
<h2>Reading the Data</h2>
<p>The signal readings were provided in <a
    href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet'>Parquet format</a> which is a
  column-oriented storage format of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. To read this data in
  Python and store it Pandas dataframe, we used a function from <code>pyarrow</code>
  package, then transposed the output of the function to get a row-oriented storage
  format. </p>
<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>This is the most important part and the one that took most of the time. Because each of
  the signals has 800,000 readings, it&#39;s essential that we extract features from those
  readings in order to build a proper training and test datasets. Training a model with
  800,000 features is not feasible with the machines that we have access to. In this part,
  for each of the training and test signals, I did the following:</p>
<h3>Signal Filtering</h3>
<p>All the operations described below are done after filtering the signals that contain a
  lot of noise as described above. To do so, we applied <a
    href='http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/filters/plot_denoise_wavelet.html'>Scikit-image&#39;s
    wavelet denoising</a> followed by <a
    href='https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.butter.html'>Scipy&#39;s
    Butterworth filter</a>. The image below shows the same signal before filtering (in
  orange) and after filtering (in blue). The overlapping is shown in dark red:</p>

<h3>Peak Calculation</h3>
<p>I used Scipy&#39;s <code>scipy.signal.find_peaks</code> function to extract useful
  features from the signals. Here is a part of <a
    href='https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html'>Scipy
    documentation about <code>find_peaks</code></a> function:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.</p>
  <p>This function takes a one-dimensional array and finds all local maxima by simple
    comparison of neighbouring values. Optionally, a subset of these peaks can be selected
    by specifying conditions for a peak’s properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used this function with different parameter combinations. For example, one time I
  used it to find peaks in the signal whose height is more than 5; another time for when
  the height is bigger than 15; another for when peak height is bigger than 15 and the
  horizontal distance between neighboring peaks is more than 25 samples; another for when
  peak height is bigger than 25 and peak width is more than 10 samples; etc. I also used
  Scipy&#39;s <code>scipy.signal.peak_prominences</code> and
  <code>scipy.signal.peak_widths</code> to get the maximum and minimum peak prominence and
  width. This gave us around 140 features.</p>
<p>I performed the peak calculation process described above to calculate negative peaks.
  For example, to get the peaks whose height is bigger than 5 (positive peaks), you would
  write:</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'>scipy.signal.find_peaks(signal, height=(5, None))
</code></pre>
<p>But if you want the corresponding negative peaks (peaks whose height is smaller than
  -5), you would write:</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'>scipy.signal.find_peaks(signal, height=(None, -5))
</code></pre>
<h3>Signal Statistical Info</h3>
<p>I used Numpy to calculate some statistics of the signals like the mean, standard
  deviation, minimum, maximum, skewness, 30th percentile, 70th percentile, etc.</p>
<h3>Feature Selection</h3>
<p>I used LightGBM&#39;s <code>feature_importance</code> function to get the most
  important features so instead of around 300 features, we selected the most important 68
  features and then added features that represent the subtraction of some features from
  others; that&#39;s because we calculated peak information for positive and negative
  peaks, so I figured that it might be useful to subtract the features of negative peaks
  from the features of positive peaks.</p>
<h2>Modeling</h2>
<p>For modeling, I used multiple classification models where each model predicts the
  probability of the existence of partial discharge in some signal, then the probabilities
  produced by all models are added and averaged (weighted average), and finally, a
  threshold value is used to convert the final probability to 0 or 1 (for example, if the
  probability is less than 0.51, then 1, else 0).</p>
<p>The models used are: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Scikit-learn&#39;s K Nearest
  Neighbors, Scikit-learn&#39;s Neural Network, Scikit-learn&#39;s Logistic Regression,
  Scikit-learn&#39;s Gaussian Naive Bayes.</p>
<p>The code used is available in <a
    href='https://github.com/ammar1y/My-Solution-to-VSB-Power-Line-Fault-Detection-Competition'>this
    Github repository</a>. First <code>final_v1</code> is run and the resulting dataframe
  is stored, then the same for <code>final_v2</code>, and finally <code>final_sub</code>
  is run which use the dataframes produced by the former two.</p>
