<p>I had a course named &quot;Data Analytics&quot; in the previous semester of my study at
  University of Malaya. We were required to do a project in this course that involves the
  main steps in the data-science process including data cleaning and preparation, data
  exploration, predictive modeling, validation, etc.</p>

<p>I decided to put an extra effort in doing this project to produce an excellent paper.
  And here you can find the resulting paper in PDF format and as a <a
    href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>

<h2>PDF</h2>

<p>You can view and download the PDF file using this link: <a

<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>

<p>You can use the Jupyter Notebook to play with code or edit anything in the document.
